- Print on a resin printer of your choosing. FDM printer is not a good choice for something this tiny.
- Print 2 copies of bogies (thus the x2 in the filename)
- Bogies are attached with M2 screws
- Wheels used are Code 110 HO scale by Kadee (with points cut off)
- Use CA glue to attach the subframe and the show plow to the cab body

Enjoy!
